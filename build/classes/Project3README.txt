A “read me” file should accompany each project – it should be submitted as a text documents (.txt) along with your code. The read me should include the following: 

• Your name 
• Course number and section 
• Assignment 
• Description of the program 
• Any instructions need to compile, run, or user your program 
• Completion statement – see below


Citations – see below Completion Statement In a paragraph describe what requirements of the assignment you completed and what requirements you failed to meet. 

Describe what about the assignment was most challenging. If you received significant help from a tutor or fellow students: Include a sentence that states you received help, 
state the name of the person that helped you and with which part(s) you received help Citations Any code that is not your own and for which you do not cite a source will be considered plagiarism and, 
at minimum, will result in a zero on the assignment.

Project Number 3: Battle Code

This program is created to make two heroes that go up against each other in order to go into combat. The original program uses their stats and dice to make them fight and defend properly. 
Once either a player goes down or the rounds end, the game will automatically end declaring the winner with the most health. This project adds an additional feature of battle and tournaments which automatically creates 
an array of characters that go up against each other until a winner is declared.

Completion Statement:
The most challenging aspect of this assignment was how annoying it is to create loops in the proper syntax, and then throwing in arrays on top of that. It can occationally become just a giant error. With some working
out, I believe we were able to work out most of the kinks loop and function wise. The array moves from space to space properly, the winning hero's  stats get reset, automatically moving odd heroes further to keep the 
rounds even, and each loop of the battles is tracked to make it easier to track. Apart from the help i got from you, all other work was done by myself. If all is well the code will continue to run happily!

Enjoy!
