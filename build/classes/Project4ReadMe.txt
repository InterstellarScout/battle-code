A “read me” file should accompany each project – it should be submitted as a text documents (.txt) along with your code. The read me should include the following: 

• Your name 
• Course number and section 
• Assignment 
• Description of the program 
• Any instructions need to compile, run, or user your program 
• Completion statement – see below


Citations – see below Completion Statement In a paragraph describe what requirements of the assignment you completed and what requirements you failed to meet. 

Describe what about the assignment was most challenging. If you received significant help from a tutor or fellow students: Include a sentence that states you received help, 
state the name of the person that helped you and with which part(s) you received help Citations Any code that is not your own and for which you do not cite a source will be considered plagiarism and, 
at minimum, will result in a zero on the assignment.

Project Number 4: Battle Code

This program is a continuation of the previous projects BattleCode. This code implements inheritence into the code to make Equipped Heroes. Small changes and additions were made to the code consisting of 
additions of new code like Equiptment which was a given and EquippedHero which was added. All Overrides and modifications to the methods were created and edited accordingly. The modification to the 
battlemanager was successful as well; adding another constructor of EquippedHero(). Other than that, all other code was left the way it needed to be. As far as the assignment is concerned, as far as I know
all requirements were met. 

Completion Statement:
The most challenging aspect of this assignment was figuring out where to put modifications in order to make the hero properly modified. For example, where to put the attack modifier. Originally I 
thought the attack modifier was going to be added to the initial creation of the hero or EquippedHero. That was not right because those modifications had to be added in the actual Attack and Defend methods. 
That opened up the need to have an override method in the EquippedHero class that would be used instead of the one in the Heroes class. All code is original and was created without any reference for once. 

Enjoy!
